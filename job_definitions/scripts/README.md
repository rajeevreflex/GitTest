# Scripts

If you have any scripts that are to be included into Jenkins Jobs, they should live in here regardless of the language they are written in.

## Should I organise my scripts?

Yes.  Please place them in the language-appropriate directory (python scripts in the python directory, ruby scripts in the ruby directory etc.)
